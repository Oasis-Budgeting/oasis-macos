## 2026-03-07 - [Insecure Default URL Scheme]
**Vulnerability:** The API client defaulted to `http` for network requests when a URL scheme was omitted, risking unencrypted transmission of sensitive data and credentials.
**Learning:** Defaulting to plaintext HTTP can easily expose authentication tokens and financial data over insecure networks. Clients should strictly enforce HTTPS by default.
**Prevention:** Always default to `https` when constructing URLs from user input or configuration that lacks an explicit scheme to ensure secure communication by default.
## 2024-05-18 - [Insecure Token Storage via AppStorage]
**Vulnerability:** The authentication token `oasis.authToken` was stored in plaintext using SwiftUI's `@AppStorage`, which writes data unencrypted to `UserDefaults`.
**Learning:** `UserDefaults` should never be used to store sensitive information like passwords or session tokens as it can be easily read on a compromised or backed-up device.
**Prevention:** Always use the `Security` framework (`Keychain`) to persist sensitive credentials. A simple `TokenManager` utilizing `kSecClassGenericPassword` can be implemented to handle secure reads and writes.
## 2024-03-05 - Secure Memory Management for SwiftUI State
**Vulnerability:** Sensitive `@State` variables (like `formPassword`) retaining credentials in memory post-usage.
**Learning:** SwiftUI's declarative nature doesn't guarantee timely memory clearing of `@State` string properties. Passwords lingered in `formPassword` after login success/failure and after user disconnection, increasing memory exposure risk.
**Prevention:** Explicitly clear sensitive state variables immediately after their necessary scope (e.g., using `defer` blocks in authentication methods, or explicitly during `disconnect`).
## 2025-03-08 - [Insecure Keychain Token Storage via Missing Accessibility Key]
**Vulnerability:** The authentication token `oasis.authToken` was stored in the Keychain without specifying an accessibility attribute (`kSecAttrAccessible`). This could allow the token to be accessed when the device is locked or compromised.
**Learning:** When saving items to the Keychain, it's crucial to specify an accessibility attribute to ensure the data is only available when necessary (e.g., when the device is unlocked).
**Prevention:** Always include the `kSecAttrAccessible` key in Keychain storage queries for sensitive data, and set it to `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked` (or an appropriate stricter value) to enforce data protection.
## 2024-05-24 - Prevent Auth Token Exposure in UI Rehydration
**Vulnerability:** Sensitive authentication tokens (`formToken`) were unnecessarily rehydrated into the UI state (`.onAppear { formToken = storedAuthToken }`) and were left in memory after login/connection functions concluded.
**Learning:** This exposes sensitive credentials via simple UI state debugging or screenshots, and increases the attack surface within the app. UI elements used to input new credentials should generally remain empty when displaying configuration to the user.
**Prevention:** Do not populate input fields with stored secure credentials on view load. Additionally, explicitly clear sensitive `form*` variables from memory using `defer` statements when they are no longer needed for their respective authentication/connection operations.
