## 2024-05-18 - [Insecure Token Storage via AppStorage]
**Vulnerability:** The authentication token `oasis.authToken` was stored in plaintext using SwiftUI's `@AppStorage`, which writes data unencrypted to `UserDefaults`.
**Learning:** `UserDefaults` should never be used to store sensitive information like passwords or session tokens as it can be easily read on a compromised or backed-up device.
**Prevention:** Always use the `Security` framework (`Keychain`) to persist sensitive credentials. A simple `TokenManager` utilizing `kSecClassGenericPassword` can be implemented to handle secure reads and writes.
